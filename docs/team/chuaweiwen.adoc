== Project: iContacts
iContacts is an address book application with target audience as university students for managing contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC. iContacts allow users to manage reminders, keep track of upcoming contacts' birthday, as well as share the contact list using the application's import and export mechanism.

This portfolio showcases the features and enhancements I have contributed to iContacts, lists my enhancement proposal for the upcoming features, and also includes other contributions I have made.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W14-B1/main/blob/master/collated/main/chuaweiwen.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W14-B1/main/blob/master/collated/test/chuaweiwen.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Nickname

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=nickname]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

* Users may want to add nickname to contacts in order to identify them easily, especially if the users have many contacts.
* The nickname serves as an additional field that can be searched using the `find` command.

---

=== Enhancement Added: Filter

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=filter]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

* Users may need a more precise search.
* The current `find` command lists the contacts that match any of the keywords (i.e. an `OR` search).
* The `filter` command is much more restrictive as it lists the contacts that match all the keywords (i.e. an `AND` search).
* The name and tags are used as the field for the filter command as they are most likely to be used as constraints in the search.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=filter]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Theme

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=theme]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

* Users can have more choice in setting the theme of iContacts.
* Users may find it easier to use iContacts if they are working on their preferred theme.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=theme]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed: Enhance the command `filter`

* Users will be able to perform an even more precise search using more fields as constraints (e.g. nickname, birthday).
* Users will also able to perform search for keywords that are incomplete (e.g. filtering `Ben` will also match `Benson`).

=== Enhancement Proposed: Enhance the command `theme` to allow customised theme

* Users will be able to customise the theme of their choice.
* Users will be able to import their own CSS file to update the theme.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add a new command `listtag`

* Users will be able to list all tags they have used when adding or editing the contacts.
* This allow the users to keep track of all the tags used.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Merge the command `nickname` to the command `add` and `edit`

* Users will be able to add, edit or remove the nickname of contact through the `add` and `edit` command.
* Since the nickname is just another field for the contact, it would be better to add and edit the nickname using the `add` and `edit` command respectively without the `nickname` command.

=== Other contributions

* Conducted acceptance testing for another project by my peers and uncovered bugs (see issue https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F11-B4/main/issues/48[#48], https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F11-B4/main/issues/49[#49], https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F11-B4/main/issues/51[#51], https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F11-B4/main/issues/52[#52])
* Fixed the grammatical errors in the User Guide and Developer Guide (see https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W14-B1/main/pull/202[#202]).
