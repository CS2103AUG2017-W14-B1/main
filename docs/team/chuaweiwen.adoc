== Project: iContacts
iContacts is an address book application with target audience as university students for managing contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 8 kLoC.

=== Enhancement Added: Nickname

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

=== Adding a nickname to a person : `nickname`[V1.1]

Adds a nickname to an existing person in the address book. +
Format: `nickname INDEX [NICKNAME]`

****
* Adds a nickname to the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last person listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* You can remove the person's nickname without specifying anything after the `INDEX`.
****

Examples:

* `nickname 1 Eddie` +
Adds a nickname `Eddie` to the 1st person.
* `nickname 1` +
Removes the nickname from the the 1st person.

==== Justification

* Users may want to add an additional name field without changing the actual name field so as to keep the list neater.
* The nickname serves as an additional field that can be searched using the `find` command.

=== Enhancement Added: Filter

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

=== Finding all people by name and associated with one or more tags: `filter`[V1.2]

Finds persons whose names and/or tag(s) contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `filter [n/NAME] [t/TAG]`

****
* To search by name, type the keywords after the `n/`.
* To search by tag, type the keywords after the `t/`.
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching all keywords will be returned (i.e. `AND` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Bo` but not `Hans Yang`
****

Examples:

* `filter n/John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `filter n/John n/Doe` +
`filter n/John Doe` +
Returns any person with both `John` and `Doe` in his name.
* `filter t/friends` +
Returns any persons with the tag `friends`.
* `filter t/friends t/colleagues` +
`filter t/friends colleagues` +
Returns any person with the tag `friends` and `colleagues`.
* `filter n/John t/friends` +
Returns any person having the name `John` and with the tag `friends`.

==== Justification

* Users may want to define a more precise search.
* The `filter` command filters name and tags as they are most likely to be used as constraints in the search.

=== Filter mechanism

The `FilterCommand` uses the `NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate` to filter the persons with matching name and/or tags. It accepts the `List<String> nameKeywords` and `List<String> tagKeywords` as parameters that are parsed by the `FilterCommandParser`. The code snippet below is the constructor for the class:

[source,java]
----
public class NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate {
    public NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String> nameKeywords, List<String> tagKeywords) {
        this.nameKeywords = nameKeywords;
        this.tagKeywords = tagKeywords;
    }
}
----

The method `test(ReadOnlyPerson person)` iterates through the `nameKeywords` and the `tagKeywords` to find a match of every `person` from the address book.

Below is an extract of the method `test(ReadOnlyPerson person)`. The tags of each person are retrieved by the `getTags()` method. This method iterates through the `tagKeywords` and counts the number of matches against the `tagsOfPerson`. If the count is equal to the size of the `tagKeywords`, this means all the keywords in the `tagKeywords` matches. The `tagFound` will then be set to `true`.

[source,java]
----
public class NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate {
    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        boolean tagFound = false;

        int numTagKeywords = tagKeywords.size();
        int tagsMatchedCount = 0;
        if (!tagKeywords.isEmpty()) {
            tagsMatchedCount = countTagMatches(person);
        }

        if (tagsMatchedCount == numTagKeywords) {
            tagFound = true;
        }
    }
}
----

Below is an extract of the same method for name. Each keywords in the `nameKeywords` will be compared against the name list retrieved from the `getName()` method of the `Person` class. If all matches, the `nameFound` will be set to `true`.

[source,java]
----
public class NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate {
    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        boolean nameFound = false;
            if (!nameKeywords.isEmpty()) {
                nameFound = nameKeywords.stream().allMatch(nameKeywords -> StringUtil
                .containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, nameKeywords));
        }
    }
}
----

For the `FilterCommand` to work properly, either the `nameKeywords` or the `tagKeywords` must be non-empty.

=== Enhancement Added: Theme

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

=== Changing the theme : `theme` [Since V1.3]

Changes the theme of the address book to a specific theme. +
Format: `theme THEME`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `dark` will match `Dark`.
* Only full theme names will be matched e.g. `dark` will not match `dar`.
****

Examples:

* `theme sky` +
Changes the theme to `sky`.

==== Justification

* Users will have more choice in setting the theme of iContacts.
* Users may find it easier to use iContacts if they are working on their preferred theme.

=== Theme-changing mechanism

_Figure 29 : Component interactions for the theme-changing mechanism_

The theme-changing mechanism is an event-driven mechanism. The above diagram shows the high-level overview of the component interactions for the theme-changing mechanism.

image::themeChangingMechanism2.png[width="790"]
_Figure 30 : Sequence diagram for the first part of the theme-changing mechanism_

As shown from the sequence diagram above, after the user entered the command `theme sky`, a new object `ThemeCommand` will be created. The `LogicManager` will then execute `ThemeCommand`, and the event `ChangeThemeRequestEvent` will be posted by `EventsCenter`. The code snippet below shows the `execute()` method of `ThemeCommand`:

----
public class ThemeCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeThemeRequestEvent(theme));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SET_THEME_SUCCESS, theme.getTheme()));
    }
}
----

image::themeChangingMechanism3.png[width="790"]
_Figure 31 : Sequence diagram for the second part of the theme-changing mechanism_

As shown from the sequence diagram above, the method `handleChangeThemeEvent()` in `MainWindow` will handle the event and change the theme of the address book through the method `changeTheme()` accordingly.
