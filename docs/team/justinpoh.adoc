== Project: iContacts
iContacts is an application that targets University students, aiming to help them manage their contacts and other aspects of their university life in an efficient manner.
iContacts is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application, where most of the commands are executed by typing rather than clicking on buttons.
Through iContacts, users would be able to store, manage and search through contact information efficiently and effectively.
Not only that, users would be able to set display pictures for each contact, and also add reminders for upcoming events.
Last but not least, iContacts allow users to easily share contact information amongst each other via its import and export mechanism.

=== Enhancement Added: Toggle

==== Justification

To make iContacts useful and appealing, it needs to be able to provide more functionality to users, and this also mean that it needs
to be able to display more information. Without this toggling mechanism, users would have to squint their eyes as all the information
and the browser would be squeezed together. Hence, to ensure a much more pleasant user experience, this toggling mechanism is required,
as it allows related information to be displayed together without being squeezed. +


However, we choose to permanently display the list of contacts as we felt that iContacts is first and foremost an address book, hence
the list of contacts is the most important information within iContacts and thus should always be displayed.

==== Justification
While iContacts allow users to store, manage and search for contact information efficiently, this alone is not
sufficient to meet the needs of University students. Students often have multiple outstanding tasks or events such as
assignments or meetings. Hence, what these students need is the ability to set reminders for upcoming tasks or events.

We chose to display the reminders chronologically instead of having them pop-up when the event is nearing as we feel
that it is more user-friendly to permanently display the reminders for the users to see. Displaying the reminders permanently
can grant users a sense of the quantity of upcoming tasks and events. Also, only reminding the users of an upcoming task or event
when it is nearing might give the user insufficient time to prepare for it. Instead, permanently displaying the reminders
with a countdown to the event allows user to better prepare for it.

We also recognise that there is a need to differentiate reminders based on the level of urgency. Therefore, we chose to do this
by coloring the reminder cells differently. Using color is simple but powerful.
